## ðŸ“Š Sample Dataset
The backend fetches live market data from **Yahoo Finance** using the `yfinance` API, so no static dataset is required.  
However, a small JSON response example is:
```json
{
  "dates": ["2024-08-10", "2024-08-11", "..."],
  "prices": [1450.25, 1462.10, "..."],
  "details": {
    "Market Cap": "18509755056128",
    "PE Ratio": "22.73",
    "Dividend Yield": "0.4",
    "EPS": "60.16",
    "Beta": "0.218",
    "Sector": "Energy",
    "Industry": "Oil & Gas Refining & Marketing"
  }
}

ðŸ›  Installation & Setup
Backend

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py

Frontend

cd frontend
npm install
npm start

The app will run at:

Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend:  http://localhost:5000

ðŸ“œ Development Approach

The Stock Dashboard was built using a modular full-stack architecture.
The backend (Flask) handles data fetching from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance API, processes it with Pandas, and serves it through REST APIs.
The frontend (React) consumes these APIs using Axios, displaying interactive charts with Recharts and detailed company statistics in an elegant UI.
Light/Dark mode was added for accessibility and personalization.

âš  Challenges Faced
Yahoo Finance API limitations sometimes caused delays in fetching data.
Handling missing or unavailable fields for certain companies.
Achieving a smooth and visually appealing chart design that works well in both light and dark modes.
Managing state efficiently in React to ensure fast updates without reloading the page.

ðŸ“Ž Deliverables
âœ… Complete source code (Frontend + Backend)
âœ… Live API data fetching
âœ… Screenshots (Light & Dark Mode)
âœ… Short project note with technologies, challenges, and setup instructions

ðŸ“Œ Future Enhancements
Add search functionality for any NSE-listed company.
Include Candlestick chart view.
Display news and sentiment analysis for selected companies.
